I recommend using [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/) or [Prism](https://prismlauncher.org/). This is a Minecraft Launcher that will allow multiple versions of Minecraft to be launched at the same time, with an easier GUI for mod management.

I have previously made a guide for this before, as seen below.
